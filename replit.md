## Development Setup

### Current Configuration
- **Port**: 5000 (configured for Replit environment)
- **Host**: 0.0.0.0 (allows external access)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with fallback to in-memory storage
- **Dev Server**: Vite with HMR enabled
- **Proxy Configuration**: `allowedHosts: true` for Replit compatibility

### Scripts
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Run production server
- `npm run db:push` - Sync database schema

### Environment Variables
See `.env.example` for complete configuration. Key variables:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - Authentication secret
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Session security
- `VITE_*` - Frontend environment variables

## Replit Integration
✅ **Configured for Replit**:
- Workflow: "Start application" running on port 5000
- Frontend properly configured with `allowedHosts: true`
- Server binds to `0.0.0.0:5000` for external access
- Deployment configured for autoscale with build/start scripts

## Database Configuration
- **Production**: Requires PostgreSQL with `DATABASE_URL`
- **Development**: Falls back to in-memory storage if no database
- **Schema**: Auto-synced with Drizzle ORM
- **Seeding**: Automatic data seeding on startup
