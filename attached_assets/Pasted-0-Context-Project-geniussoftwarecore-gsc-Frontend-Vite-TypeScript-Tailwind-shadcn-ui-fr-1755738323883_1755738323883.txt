0) Context

Project: geniussoftwarecore/gsc

Frontend: Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + framer-motion + i18n (ar/en) + RTL/LTR

Theme: White + Sky Blue (color tokens already defined in tailwind.config.ts)

Rule: Do not break other sections, keep the existing design system consistent.

1) Add “Subscribe” and “Start Free Trial” Buttons on Home Page

Location: Hero section or top of homepage (client/src/components/home/HomeHero.tsx).

Add two buttons:

Primary: “Start Free Trial” → navigates to /services page.

Secondary: “Subscribe Now” → also navigates to /services (later can redirect to /pricing).

Style:

Primary: outline style, hover → filled with brand.sky.accent and dark text.

Secondary: text-only with a small arrow icon.

Motion:

Animate with framer-motion (fade/slide-in, hover lift with subtle shadow).

i18n keys:

home.hero.cta.trial = “Start Free Trial”

home.hero.cta.subscribe = “Subscribe Now”

If /services doesn’t exist, create it at client/src/pages/services.tsx with simple service cards (Web, Mobile, ERP, AI) and a link to “Contact Us.”

2) Add “Contact Us” in Navbar

Location: Navbar component (client/src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx).

Add a new menu item “Contact Us” linking to /contact.

If not present, create client/src/pages/contact.tsx:

Simple form: name, email, subject, message (using shadcn/ui Input, Textarea, Button).

Validation: required fields + email pattern.

Submit button sends POST → /api/contact (temporary endpoint returning 200 OK).

Show toast for success/failure.

3) Update Logo in Navbar

Goal: Display logo in White + Sky Blue colors + company name.

In Navbar.tsx:

Add a lightweight SVG icon (circle or diamond) in brand.sky.accent.

Place text “Genius Software Core” beside it in font-semibold, brand.text.primary.

Ensure balanced spacing (gap-2) and consistent height (h-8 ~ h-10).

Responsive: on smaller screens, hide the text and keep only the icon if necessary.

Link logo → / (homepage).

4) Optional Modern Enhancements

Top Banner (Announcement Bar):

Text: “Start your free trial today” + link to /services.

Background brand.sky.light, dismissible with “x.”

Scroll Progress Indicator:

Thin progress bar at top showing scroll completion.

Floating CTA (Mobile only):

Small fixed button bottom-right → opens sheet with “Try Now / Contact.”

Accessibility:

Focus-visible styles, aria-labels, aria-current="page" for active links.

5) Performance & RTL

Respect dir="rtl" for Arabic and flip icons accordingly.

Use SVG for logo, no heavy images.

Lazy load any images in /services.

Fix image dimensions to avoid CLS.

6) Routing

Ensure pages exist:

/services (services overview page).

/contact (contact form page).

Hero buttons → /services for now (later “Subscribe” can redirect to /pricing).

7) Testing (Acceptance Criteria)

Hero section shows “Start Free Trial” and “Subscribe Now” buttons → working links.

Navbar includes “Contact Us” link → /contact page with functional form + toast.

Navbar logo updated with White + Sky Blue style + text “Genius Software Core.”

RTL/LTR works properly.

No console errors in dev.
