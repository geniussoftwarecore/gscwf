Replit AI — Execute Exactly as Follows
1) General Objective

Create a Portfolio Section that is production-ready, fast, scalable, fully RTL/Arabic with English support. It should include:

An index page listing our projects

A details page for each project

Filters / search / sorting

A lightbox for images

KPI/impact elements

A clean and modern design.

2) Technology & Setup

Framework: Next.js 14+ (App Router) with React 18

Styling: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (cards, buttons, chips) + framer-motion for subtle animations

Icons: lucide-react

i18n: JSON files (ar / en) + automatic direction switching based on language

Images: Next/Image with blur placeholder, srcset, and WebP/AVIF when possible

Lightbox: photoswipe (or any lightweight alternative) via dynamic import

SEO: next-seo + Schema.org markup (CreativeWork/Project)

If the project is not using Next.js, create an HTML + CSS + JS version with the same structure and features as much as possible.

3) Routing & File Structure

Index route: /portfolio

Dynamic detail route: /portfolio/[slug]

Content data:
Use /content/portfolio/ as MDX files (or JSON inside /data/portfolio.json) for each project, with fields like:

{
  "slug": "smart-crm-platform",
  "title_ar": "منصة CRM ذكية",
  "title_en": "Smart CRM Platform",
  "client": "Genius Software Core",
  "industry": "Software",
  "year": 2025,
  "services": ["Web Development", "ERP Integration"],
  "tech": ["Next.js", "Tailwind", "ASP.NET", "SQL Server"],
  "tags": ["Dashboard", "Analytics", "RTL"],
  "cover": "/images/portfolio/crm/cover.webp",
  "gallery": ["/images/portfolio/crm/1.webp", "/images/portfolio/crm/2.webp"],
  "video": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/xxxx",
  "summary_ar": "ملخص عربي قصير عن المشروع وقيمته.",
  "summary_en": "Short English summary of the project and value.",
  "problem_ar": "مشكلة العميل قبل الحل.",
  "solution_ar": "كيف نفذنا الحل (تقنياً ووظيفياً).",
  "outcomes_kpis": [
    {"name_ar": "تخفيض زمن المعالجة", "value": "−38%"},
    {"name_ar": "زيادة الإنتاجية", "value": "+24%"}
  ],
  "testimonials": [
    {"author": "Client Manager", "quote_ar": "نتائج ممتازة واستجابة سريعة."}
  ],
  "status": "delivered",
  "links": {
    "demo": "https://demo.example.com",
    "repo": "https://github.com/... (optional)"
  }
}


Provide at least 8 sample items across different industries.

4) Component Interfaces

Create the following components inside components/portfolio/:

PortfolioHero
Attractive title + short description + small counters (projects / industries / years).

FiltersBar
Text search + filters (industry, service type, tech, year).
Multi-select chips + dropdown for sorting (latest, most viewed, by industry).
State saved in query params for shareable links.

ProjectCard
Clean card, fixed-ratio cover image, status badge, title, client, and tags.
Subtle hover effect + framer-motion animation.
Full RTL support (mirrored icons, correct alignment).

PortfolioGrid
Responsive grid (1 → 4 columns) with Masonry-like CSS grid auto-rows + skeleton loaders.
Infinite scroll or pagination with IntersectionObserver.

ActiveFiltersSummary
Bar showing active filters with “clear all” button.

LightboxGallery (dynamic import)
Open full-size images, keyboard navigation, touch support.

SortDropdown, TagChip, SearchInput
Small elements with full accessibility (aria-labels, clear focus states).

ProjectDetailHeader
Cover image + title + client + buttons (“Visit Project”, “Technical Details” scroll-to).

ProjectDetailBody
Sections: problem, solution, technologies, results/KPIs, testimonial, gallery/video, related projects.

ShareButtons
Copy link, Twitter/LinkedIn.

RelatedProjects
3–6 related projects by industry/tech.

5) User Experience & Interaction

RTL first: Set dir="rtl" when language is Arabic. Automatically mirror icons and alignments.

Design traits: Clean, professional Arabic fonts (Cairo / IBM Plex Arabic), rounded corners (2xl), soft shadows, comfortable white space, light animations (0.2–0.3s).

Accessibility (a11y): Full keyboard support, proper contrast ratios, respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Performance: Optimized images, code-splitting for heavy libraries (lightbox/video), prefetch links, low LCP.

6) Index Page /portfolio

Hero section + FiltersBar + PortfolioGrid.

Highlight “Proven Results” (overall KPI bar: avg delivery time, satisfaction %, industry count).

Save filters into ?q=&industry=&services=&tech=&year=&sort= with safe read/write state.

7) Detail Page /portfolio/[slug]

Header: title, client, industry, year, services, tech (badges).

“Story/Value” section (default Arabic text) + KPIs in small cards.

Gallery: image grid with Lightbox + optional video iframe.

Before/After (if present): simple JS comparison slider.

CTA buttons: “Contact Us” + “Similar Project?” with internal links.

SEO/OG: title, description, og:image + Schema Project with aggregateRating if available.

8) Performance & Tests

Simple tests (Jest/RTL) for filter/search/sort components.

Lighthouse ≥ 90 for performance/accessibility/best practices on index & details.

9) Documentation

Add README.md titled “Adding a New Project to the Portfolio”, explaining:

Where to add MDX/JSON file

Required fields

When to add WebP images + generate blur placeholders

How to create a proper slug

How to test locally and push updates

10) Definition of Done (DoD)

Works in both Arabic/English with auto direction switching

Index + details + filters/search/sort with state saved in URL

Optimized images + Lightbox + Skeleton + Infinite Scroll/Pagination

Effective SEO (titles, descriptions, OG, Schema)

Full accessibility + keyboard navigation

No console errors, no broken links

Modern design matching the above criteria

11) Key Design Notes (Arabic)

Reverse alignment of columns, lists, tables, and flows automatically in Arabic (RTL).

Use clear Arabic fonts for UI and headings, with medium to semibold weight for titles.

Chips/filters should start from right-to-left, with the close (×) icon on the left in Arabic.

12) Required Sample Data

Build 8 demo projects (industries: Government, E-commerce, Healthcare, Education, Logistics, Finance, Industrial, Media).

Each project: cover + 3 gallery images + 1 optional video + at least 2 KPIs + a short client testimonial.

Deliverables

Once implemented, show me:

Screenshots of the index and detail pages (Arabic).

Local preview links.

A sample JSON/MDX file for one project.

A Lighthouse report summary (performance/accessibility).

Final Note: Ensure columns, spacing, and arrow directions are automatically reversed in Arabic UI, including dropdowns, tabs, and Lightbox navigation buttons.
