Add a Subscribe button, a Login button, and a Register button to the home screen.

Very excellent! Adding a "Subscribe" button, a "Log In" button, and a "Register" button to the home screen gives the platform a professional feel and makes it easier for users to start interacting with your services.

✅ Here's where these buttons can be placed and how they work:
🎯 First: Button placement on the home screen
🔹 1. The top bar (Header)
The "Log In" button – located in the top right.

The "Register" button – next to the Log In button, in a prominent color.

The "Subscribe" button – either next to the buttons above, or mainly in the Hero Section (the main heading of the site).

Suggested Design:

CSS
Copy
Edit
[Logo] [Home] [Services] [Our Business] [Contact Us] [🔓 Login] [📝 Register] [⭐ Subscribe]
🔹 2. Within the Hero Section (the main element in the middle of the page)
Directly in the middle of the page, under the main heading (e.g., "Turn your idea into a successful app or website"), there could be a prominent button:

🎯 ⭐ Subscribe Now

🔹 3. At the end of each section on the home page
After each service or feature offer, a button could be repeated:

➡️ Register Now and Start Your Project

✳️ Functions of the buttons:
The button takes you to... Details
🔓 Login: The login page contains an email and password form, and the "Sign in via Gmail" option.
📝 Register: The signup page contains a user information form, selects the customer type (individual or business), and the option to register via Gmail.
⭐ Subscribe: The subscription page displays Packages and plans, with a payment button or submit a quote request.

🔐 Login/Register via Gmail:
You can use Google OAuth to log in or register directly via Gmail.
Suggested libraries:

For Frontend (React): react-oauth/google

For Backend (Node.js, Laravel, or Django): Connect using Google's verification token.

✨ Do you want me to add these buttons to your Figma design as well?
