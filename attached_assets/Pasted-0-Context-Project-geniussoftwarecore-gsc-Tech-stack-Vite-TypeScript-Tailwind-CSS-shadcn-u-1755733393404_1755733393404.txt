0) Context

Project: geniussoftwarecore/gsc

Tech stack: Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui + framer-motion

Brand Identity: White + Sky Blue (color tokens already added in tailwind.config.ts)

Goal: Improve the Hero section (top introduction of the homepage) to look more modern, perform better, and engage users with clear emphasis on platform services — while staying consistent with the existing design system (white + sky theme, typography, radii, shadows, spacing).

Rule: Do not modify other homepage sections. Keep typography, spacing, and design style consistent with the rest of the platform.

1) Location

Open the homepage file (e.g., client/src/pages/index.tsx or equivalent).

Replace or update the current hero section with a new component HomeHero.tsx under:

client/src/components/home/HomeHero.tsx

2) Hero Structure

Build HomeHero with the following elements:

Top Badge (Optional)

Small badge that conveys value, e.g., “Complete Digital Platform.”

Background: brand.sky.light, text dark.

Main Heading + Subtitle

Localized headline (ar/en):

ar: “نُحوّل أفكارك إلى منتجات رقمية فعّالة”

en: “We turn ideas into effective digital products”

Subtitle: two lines explaining key services (Web, Mobile, ERP, AI, Automation).

Call-to-Action (CTA) Buttons

Primary CTA: “Start Your Project” → contact/request quote page.

Outline style, hover → filled brand.sky.accent with dark text.

Secondary CTA: “View Our Work” → /portfolio.

Service Highlights Grid

Responsive grid (2×2 desktop, 2×1 mobile).

Four highlights: “Web Development”, “Mobile Apps”, “ERP/CRM Solutions”, “AI & Automation.”

Each card: icon (lucide-react), short title, one-line description.

Styled like shadcn/ui Cards.

Optional Illustration/Image

Use lightweight SVG/illustration or small UI screenshot.

Lazy-loaded, with fixed dimensions to avoid CLS.

3) Motion & Interactivity

Use framer-motion for smooth animations:

Headline & subtitle:

initial={{opacity:0, y:12}}

whileInView={{opacity:1, y:0}}

viewport={{ once:true, amount:0.5 }}

CTAs: slight delay transition={{ delay: 0.08 }}.

Service cards: staggered children (0.04s) with fade + slight scale.

Clear hover states for buttons and cards (subtle shadow + lift).

4) Styling

Background: bg-white.

Generous vertical spacing (py-16 to py-24 on desktop).

Heading: text-brand.text.primary, subtitle: text-brand.text.muted.

Borders/dividers: brand.sky.base or brand.sky.light.

Maintain AA contrast compliance.

5) i18n and RTL/LTR

All texts via i18n JSON:

home.hero.badge, home.hero.title, home.hero.subtitle,

home.hero.primaryCta, home.hero.secondaryCta,

home.hero.services.web, mobile, erp, ai (title + description).

When Arabic: dir="rtl" on container.

When English: dir="ltr".

Flip icons if necessary for RTL.

6) Performance

No heavy libraries.

Lazy-load any images/illustrations.

Define fixed image dimensions to avoid CLS.

Use loading="lazy" and memoize where possible.

7) Accessibility

Main heading <h1>, subtitle <p>.

CTA buttons with descriptive aria-label.

Keyboard navigation with visible focus-visible states.

Alt text for meaningful images/icons.

8) Component API (Props) — optional for future customization

Accept props for:

Custom text overrides.

Services list { icon, title_ar, title_en, desc_ar, desc_en }.

CTA links.

By default, pull text from i18n.

9) Integration

In index.tsx, import and place <HomeHero /> at the top of the homepage before “Our Work.”

Pass correct CTA links (/contact, /portfolio).

10) Testing (Acceptance Criteria)

Heading, subtitle, and CTAs appear aligned with design identity.

Service highlights render responsively (mobile → desktop).

CTAs work and link correctly.

Animations smooth and lightweight.

i18n works with RTL/LTR.

No console errors/warnings in dev.

11) Delivery (Commits & PR)

Suggested commits:

feat(home-hero): new responsive hero with CTAs and service highlights

style(theme): apply white+sky hero palette and motion polish

chore(i18n): add home.hero keys (ar/en)

Open PR titled:

Home Hero: improved design, performance & interactivity (white+sky)

12) Optional Conversion Boosters

Add small social proof line under CTAs (e.g., “Trusted by leading companies”).

Badge like “Response within 24h” next to CTA.

Optional downward arrow → smooth scroll to #our-work.
