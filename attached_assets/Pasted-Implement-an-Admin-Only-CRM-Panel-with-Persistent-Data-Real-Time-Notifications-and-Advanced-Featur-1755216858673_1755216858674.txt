Implement an Admin‑Only CRM Panel with Persistent Data, Real‑Time Notifications, and Advanced Features in the GSC Platform

Tasks to Implement

Set up an admin account:

Create a new file client/src/data/users.ts containing a default admin user:

export const users = [
  {
    id: "admin-1",
    name: "Admin",
    email: "admin@example.com",
    role: "admin",
    password: "123",
  },
];


Add a function authenticateUser(email: string, password: string) that returns the user if they exist and the password matches.

In login.tsx, use this function instead of creating dummy user data; when credentials match the admin account, set role to 'admin'.

Create a route and page for the CRM:

Add a new route in App.tsx for /admin/crm and import a new AdminCRM page to display the CRM panel:

<Route path="/admin/crm" component={AdminCRM} />


Create client/src/pages/admin/crm.tsx and wrap its content with <AdminRoute> so only admins can access it:

import { AdminRoute } from "@/components/auth/AdminRoute";
export default function AdminCRM() {
  return (
    <AdminRoute>
      {/* CRM content goes here */}
    </AdminRoute>
  );
}


Build the CRM interface for handling client messages:

In AdminCRM.tsx, import helper functions from clientRequests.ts such as getAllRequests and addResponseToRequest.

Display a table or list of all client requests (type “request,” “suggestion,” or “comment”) with details like customer name, service, status, creation date, and any attachments.

Add a button or link for each request that opens a form allowing the admin to write a reply. When sending:

Call addResponseToRequest to save the reply within the request.

Add a new client notification of type reply via addNotification.

Provide filtering options (by status or service type) and a search box.

Display notifications within the CRM:

Use useNotifications() in the CRM page to show a list of new notifications (e.g., new requests or unread replies).

Add a section or tab inside the CRM to display notifications with the ability to mark them as read.

Hide CRM links from non-admin users:

In the navigation bar or admin dashboard, only show a link to /admin/crm if isAdmin is true:

const { isAdmin } = useAuth();
{isAdmin && <Link href="/admin/crm">CRM Panel</Link>}


Update data structures to store replies and attachments:

Modify clientRequests.ts so the ClientRequest interface includes fields like responses?: Response[] and attachments?: string[].

Add a function addResponseToRequest(requestId: string, response: Response) to append replies and update storage.

Update the user dashboard (dashboard.tsx) requests tab to display any replies sent by the admin and allow users to download attached files.

Ensure proper access control:

Wrap all admin pages (including /admin/dashboard and the new /admin/crm) with <AdminRoute> to prevent non-admin users from accessing them.

Persist data across sessions:

Modify clientRequests.ts, notifications, and any future transactions or responses to load from and save to localStorage (or integrate with a backend) so that requests, replies, and notifications are retained after refreshing the page.

Add logic in helper functions such as addClientRequest and addResponseToRequest to update localStorage whenever data changes.

Add real‑time notifications (optional but recommended):

Integrate a WebSocket or similar real‑time communication library to push new request or reply notifications to admins instantly. Update the NotificationContext to subscribe to these updates and refresh the UI automatically.

Handle attachments in the CRM:

When displaying requests in the CRM, include links or buttons to view or download any attached files (e.g., PDFs or images) that clients uploaded via the contact form.

Implement logging and analytics:

Add a simple analytics module to record metrics such as the total number of requests, average response time, and number of pending replies.

Display these metrics in summary cards or charts within the CRM to help the admin team monitor workload and performance.
