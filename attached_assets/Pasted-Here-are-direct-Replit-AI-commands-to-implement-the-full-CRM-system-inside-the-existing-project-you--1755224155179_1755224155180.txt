Step 1 – Project Analysis "Analyze the current project structure and list all files and main functionalities. Summarize the tech stack used and identify where new CRM features can be integrated."

Step 2 – Database Setup "Add CRM-related database tables and models to support: Leads, Contacts, Accounts, Opportunities, Tasks, and Support Tickets. Ensure proper relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many) are defined."
