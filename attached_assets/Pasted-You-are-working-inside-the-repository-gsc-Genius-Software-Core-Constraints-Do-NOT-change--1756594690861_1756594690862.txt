You are working inside the repository “gsc” (Genius Software Core). 
Constraints:
- Do NOT change global styles, theming, layout system, spacing scale, or color palette.
- Reuse existing components and Tailwind tokens defined in the repo (see tailwind.config and components.json).
- Keep the same look & feel of the current site; only add structured content + light interactivity.

1) Locate the Services route/component:
- Search the repo for a Services page in these folders (in order): /client, /crm_ui.
- Common file patterns to check: src/pages/services.(tsx|jsx), src/routes/services.(tsx|jsx), app/(marketing)/services/page.tsx, or a “ServicesSection” component used in the Home page.
- If a Services route already exists, extend it with the data model below and map over it.
- If not found, create a Services page using the existing routing convention in the app (Vite/React). Keep the same overall layout wrapper, header, container widths, and grid classes used elsewhere in marketing pages.

2) Create a typed data source for services:
- Add a file: /client/src/content/services.ts (or the closest equivalent under the current client codebase).
- Export an array of objects with this interface:

type Service = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  tagline: string;
  description: string;
  features: string[];
  deliverables: string[];
  inputsNeeded: string[];
  interactiveIdeas: string[];
  category: "Web" | "Mobile" | "ERP" | "AI" | "Design" | "Cloud" | "Data" | "Commerce" | "Support";
  icon?: string; // lucide-react icon name if available in the project
  cta?: { label: string; href: string; };
};

- Populate with these 10 services (verbatim). Keep punctuation and capitalization:

3) Render UI using existing design system:
- Build a Services grid using the same container, spacing, and grid utilities used in other marketing sections (match padding, breakpoints, shadows, radius).
- For each service: show icon (lucide if present), name, tagline, short description, bullet features, CTA button.
- Add collapsible sections: “What you get”, “What we need from you”, “Interactive ideas”.
- Add an optional filter bar (categories) and a search input (debounced) if the site already includes a filter/search pattern. If not present, skip it to avoid design drift.

4) Links/CTAs:
- All CTAs must point to /contact with a prefilled subject query param (already included in the data).
- Do not introduce new global nav items.

5) i18n:
- If an i18n utility exists in the app, wrap strings accordingly. If not, keep plain strings for now.

6) QA checklist:
- Lighthouse: no regressions in performance/SEO/accessibility vs. current pages.
- Keyboard + screen reader friendly for collapsibles.
- No change to global styles, header, footer, or typography scale.

7) Files to touch (adjust to actual structure you find):
- /client/src/content/services.ts (new)
- /client/src/pages/services.tsx OR the existing Services route component
- Any existing UI atoms for Card/Accordion/Badge if needed (reuse, don’t restyle)

8) Output:
- Commit with message: "feat(services): add structured services content, mapped UI, and CTAs without design changes"
- Provide a short summary of what changed and where.
